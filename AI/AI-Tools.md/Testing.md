### Code Testing Using AI Tools

#### Prerequisites
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs).
- An account with the respective AI tool if required.
- Familiarity with the programming language you are using for testing.

### 1. Using GitHub Copilot for Testing

#### Setup
1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install GitHub Copilot Extension**: 
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot" and install it.
3. **Sign In**: Follow the prompts to sign in with your GitHub account.

#### Basic Usage for Testing
- **Write Test Cases**: Start by writing a test case. For example, if you have a function `add`, you can write:
   ```javascript
   test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
       expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
   });
   ```
- **Get Suggestions**: As you type, Copilot will provide suggestions for additional test cases. You can accept the suggestions by pressing `Tab`.
  
- **Generating Mock Data**: If you need mock data for testing, write a comment describing the data you need, and Copilot will suggest a structure. For example:
   ```javascript
   // Mock user data
   const user = {
   ```
  
#### Tips
- Use descriptive comments to guide Copilot’s suggestions for test scenarios.
- Consider edge cases and ask Copilot for suggestions by writing comments like:
   ```javascript
   // Test adding negative numbers
   ```

### 2. Using Codeium for Testing

#### Setup
1. **Install Codeium**: 
   - Go to the [Codeium website](https://codeium.com/) and download the installer for your IDE.
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, JetBrains).
2. **Create an Account**: If prompted, create a Codeium account and sign in.

#### Basic Usage for Testing
- **Generating Test Functions**: Start by typing a test function:
   ```python
   def test_multiply():
   ```
- **Receive Suggestions**: Codeium will provide suggestions for assertions and setup. For example, you might see suggestions for:
   ```python
   assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
   ```
- **Using Contextual Prompts**: Codeium can analyze your code to provide more relevant test cases. If you have a complex function, it will suggest various edge cases.

#### Tips
- Use specific comments to get focused suggestions from Codeium, such as:
   ```python
   # Test dividing by zero
   ```

### 3. Using Amazon CodeWhisperer for Testing

#### Setup
1. **Install Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IDE**: Ensure you have one of these IDEs installed.
2. **Install CodeWhisperer**:
   - Go to the [AWS Toolkit](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) page for your IDE and install the AWS Toolkit extension.
   - Sign in to your AWS account to enable CodeWhisperer.

#### Basic Usage for Testing
- **Writing Unit Tests**: Create a unit test in Java, for instance:
   ```java
   @Test
   public void testSubtract() {
       assertEquals(3, subtract(5, 2));
   }
   ```
- **Receive Suggestions**: CodeWhisperer will suggest additional test cases based on the method you are testing and the context.

#### Tips
- Leverage security scanning to ensure your tests do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- Utilize CodeWhisperer’s integration with AWS services to test cloud-based applications.

### 4. Using Tabnine for Testing

#### Setup
1. **Install Tabnine**:
   - Go to the [Tabnine website](https://www.tabnine.com/) and download the installer for your IDE.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your specific IDE.
2. **Create an Account**: Optionally, create an account to sync settings and access additional features.

#### Basic Usage for Testing
- **Generating Test Code**: Start writing a test function, for example:
   ```ruby
   describe 'add' do
       it 'returns the sum of two numbers' do
   ```
- **Receive AI Suggestions**: Tabnine will provide completions as you type, such as:
   ```ruby
   expect(add(1, 2)).to eq(3)
   ```
  
- **Use Local Training**: If you have trained Tabnine on your codebase, it will provide more relevant test cases based on your coding style.

#### Tips
- Explore Tabnine’s settings to enable features like team learning, which can improve the quality of test generation.
