### Circuit Breakers in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, where many services interact with each other over the network, failures can occur due to various reasons such as slow response times, network issues, or service outages. A **circuit breaker** pattern helps to handle such failures gracefully, by "breaking the circuit" (stopping calls to a failing service) when failures reach a certain threshold. This prevents cascading failures across services and helps the system recover.

### What is a Circuit Breaker?

The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly repeating. It has three states:
1. **Closed**: The circuit is closed, and the system is functioning normally. Requests are allowed to pass through.
2. **Open**: The circuit opens when a certain number of failures occur, and further requests are blocked to prevent further damage.
3. **Half-Open**: After a timeout period, the circuit goes into this state, allowing a limited number of requests to check if the underlying issue is resolved. If they succeed, the circuit is closed again; otherwise, it opens again.

The circuit breaker improves the system’s resilience by stopping services from repeatedly making calls to a service that is not functioning well.

### Resilience4j Overview

**Resilience4j** is a lightweight fault tolerance library designed for Java applications. It provides various resilience patterns, such as:
- Circuit Breaker
- Rate Limiter
- Retry
- Bulkhead
- Time Limiter

Resilience4j is a great choice for implementing the circuit breaker pattern in microservices since it's designed to work well with frameworks like Spring Boot.

### Steps to Set Up a Circuit Breaker in Spring Boot Using Resilience4j

#### 1. Add Dependencies

First, you need to add the necessary dependencies for Resilience4j and Spring Boot.

For Maven, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter Web -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Resilience4j Circuit Breaker -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.1</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Spring Boot Actuator (optional but recommended for monitoring) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

For Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-spring-boot2:1.7.1'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator' // Optional for monitoring
}
```

#### 2. Configuration

Next, configure the circuit breaker settings. In Spring Boot, this can be done using `application.properties` or `application.yml`. Below is an example configuration in `application.properties`:

```properties
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.slidingWindowSize=5
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.failureRateThreshold=50
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.waitDurationInOpenState=10000
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=3
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.minimumNumberOfCalls=10
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.slowCallDurationThreshold=2000
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.yourServiceName.slowCallRateThreshold=50
```

- **slidingWindowSize**: The number of calls to keep in the sliding window.
- **failureRateThreshold**: The percentage of failures (out of the total number of calls) that will trigger the circuit breaker to open.
- **waitDurationInOpenState**: The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before transitioning from an open state to a half-open state.
- **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState**: The number of calls that are allowed to test whether the circuit should transition from half-open to closed.
- **slowCallDurationThreshold**: A call is considered slow if it takes longer than this threshold (in milliseconds).
- **slowCallRateThreshold**: The percentage of slow calls that will cause the circuit breaker to open.

#### 3. Annotate the Service with Circuit Breaker

Now you can annotate your service methods with the `@CircuitBreaker` annotation to apply the circuit breaker pattern. You can specify the name of the circuit breaker and a fallback method to execute in case of failure.

Here’s an example of a service class:

```java
package com.example.service;

import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Service
public class ExternalApiService {

    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @CircuitBreaker(name = "yourServiceName", fallbackMethod = "fallbackForApiCall")
    public String callExternalApi() {
        String url = "http://external-api.com/resource";
        return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
    }

    // Fallback method in case of failure
    public String fallbackForApiCall(Throwable throwable) {
        return "External service is currently unavailable, please try again later.";
    }
}
```

- **@CircuitBreaker**: This annotation marks the method that should be protected by a circuit breaker.
    - **name**: The name of the circuit breaker instance (matches the configuration).
    - **fallbackMethod**: The name of the fallback method to be executed when the circuit breaker is open or a failure occurs.

The `callExternalApi` method will make a call to an external API, but if it fails (or takes too long), the `fallbackForApiCall` method will be invoked.

#### 4. Testing the Circuit Breaker

You can test the circuit breaker by making calls to the service and deliberately causing failures (e.g., by turning off the external API or introducing delays). Monitor the behavior of the circuit breaker by tracking how it opens and closes after failures and retries.

For monitoring, Spring Boot Actuator can be useful. It exposes the circuit breaker metrics at `/actuator/metrics`.

To expose the actuator endpoints, add the following to your `application.properties`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
```

Once enabled, you can access the circuit breaker metrics at `/actuator/metrics/resilience4j.circuitbreaker.calls`.

#### 5. Customize Circuit Breaker Behavior (Optional)

You can programmatically customize the circuit breaker behavior as well, by using the `CircuitBreakerRegistry` provided by Resilience4j. Here’s an example of how to create a circuit breaker programmatically:

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreaker;
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerConfig;
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerRegistry;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import java.time.Duration;

@Configuration
public class CircuitBreakerConfig {

    @Bean
    public CircuitBreakerRegistry circuitBreakerRegistry() {
        CircuitBreakerConfig config = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
                .failureRateThreshold(50) // Open circuit after 50% failures
                .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofSeconds(10)) // Time to wait in open state before transitioning to half-open
                .slidingWindowSize(5) // Size of the sliding window
                .build();

        return CircuitBreakerRegistry.of(config);
    }

    @Bean
    public CircuitBreaker customCircuitBreaker(CircuitBreakerRegistry circuitBreakerRegistry) {
        return circuitBreakerRegistry.circuitBreaker("customCircuitBreaker");
    }
}
```

You can use this custom circuit breaker instance in your services.
