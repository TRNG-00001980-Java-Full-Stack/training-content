In Spring Boot, transaction management is an essential aspect for ensuring data consistency and integrity, particularly when working with databases. Spring provides powerful support for transaction management through annotations, declarative configurations, and programmatic transaction handling.

### 1. **Types of Transaction Management in Spring Boot**

Spring Boot supports two types of transaction management:

- **Programmatic Transaction Management**: This involves managing transactions in the code by using the `TransactionTemplate` or `PlatformTransactionManager`. It provides fine-grained control but can be tedious to maintain.
  
- **Declarative Transaction Management**: This is the preferred approach in Spring Boot, where transactions are managed using annotations. Spring handles the transaction boundaries without manual coding, simplifying the process.

   - The `@Transactional` annotation is typically used for declarative transaction management. It can be applied to methods at the service layer to mark them as transactional.

### 2. **@Transactional Annotation**

The `@Transactional` annotation provides declarative transaction management. It allows you to define transactional behavior at the method or class level.

**Example:**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

The `@Transactional` annotation has several parameters to customize the behavior of the transaction:
- **propagation**: Defines how the method participates in an existing transaction.
- **isolation**: Sets the isolation level of the transaction (e.g., READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, SERIALIZABLE).
- **timeout**: Specifies the time in seconds the transaction can run before it gets rolled back automatically.
- **readOnly**: A boolean flag to mark the transaction as read-only, which can optimize performance for non-modifying operations.
- **rollbackFor**: Defines exceptions that will trigger a rollback.

### 3. **Propagation Strategies**

The **propagation** attribute in the `@Transactional` annotation determines how the transaction should behave when there is an existing transaction. Here are the key propagation strategies:

- **REQUIRED (default)**: If there’s an existing transaction, it will join it; otherwise, a new transaction will be created.
  
  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
  public void updateUser(User user) {
      userRepository.save(user);
  }
  ```

- **REQUIRES_NEW**: Always starts a new transaction. If there is an existing transaction, it will be suspended, and a new one will begin.
  
  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
  public void createAuditLog(AuditLog log) {
      auditRepository.save(log);
  }
  ```

- **NESTED**: Executes within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists. It allows rollback only for the nested transaction, not the entire outer transaction.
  
  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NESTED)
  public void nestedTransaction() {
      userRepository.update(user);
  }
  ```

- **MANDATORY**: The method must be executed within an existing transaction; if no transaction exists, an exception is thrown.
  
  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)
  public void mandatoryOperation() {
      // Requires an existing transaction
  }
  ```

- **SUPPORTS**: It will participate in an existing transaction if there is one; otherwise, it will run non-transactionally.
  
  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.SUPPORTS)
  public void readOnlyOperation() {
      // Runs non-transactionally if no existing transaction
  }
  ```

- **NOT_SUPPORTED**: The method will always run non-transactionally. If there is an existing transaction, it will be suspended.

  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
  public void nonTransactionalOperation() {
      // No transaction
  }
  ```

- **NEVER**: The method should never run within a transaction. If a transaction exists, an exception is thrown.

  ```java
  @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)
  public void noTransactionAllowed() {
      // No transaction allowed
  }
  ```

### 4. **Isolation Levels**

In Spring, you can also define isolation levels for transactions using the `isolation` attribute. Isolation levels handle the visibility of data across different transactions.

- **READ_UNCOMMITTED**: The lowest isolation level; one transaction can read changes made by another transaction before it's committed.
- **READ_COMMITTED**: Default isolation level for most databases. One transaction can only read changes that have been committed.
- **REPEATABLE_READ**: Ensures that if a transaction reads a record, it will always see the same data throughout its execution.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: The highest isolation level; transactions are fully isolated from each other, but it can lead to performance overhead.

### 5. **Rollback and Exception Handling**

By default, Spring rolls back transactions for **unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException)** and commits for **checked exceptions**. However, you can customize this behavior with the `rollbackFor` and `noRollbackFor` attributes.

**Example:**

```java
@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)
public void saveUser(User user) throws Exception {
    userRepository.save(user);
}
```

This method will roll back for both checked and unchecked exceptions.

### 6. **Programmatic Transaction Management (Optional)**

For more advanced use cases, Spring offers programmatic control over transactions using `TransactionTemplate` or `PlatformTransactionManager`. While less common due to the ease of declarative transactions, it is helpful when you need fine-grained control.

**Example:**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager;

    public void saveUser(User user) {
        TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
        transactionTemplate.execute(status -> {
            userRepository.save(user);
            return null;
        });
    }
}
```

### Summary

Spring Boot’s transaction management system, powered by the `@Transactional` annotation, offers a flexible way to manage transactions declaratively. The propagation strategies enable control over transaction boundaries, while isolation levels ensure proper data visibility between concurrent transactions. By fine-tuning these strategies, you can build robust and scalable transactional systems.
